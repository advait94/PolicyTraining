            <h3>Incident Response: What to Do in Case of a Security Incident</h3><p>A rapid and coordinated response is critical. Your immediate action can prevent a small incident from becoming a major crisis.</p>

                    <p>What is a Security Incident?</p>
                </div>
            </div><p>Any event that compromises the Confidentiality, Integrity, or Availability (CIA) of our information systems or data.</p><h3>Think: Anything that seems "off" or indicates something bad has happened to our data or systems.</h3><h3>Examples:</h3><p>Your computer behaving unusually (slow, pop-ups, files disappearing).</p><p>You or a colleague accidentally clicked on a phishing email link or opened a suspicious attachment.</p><p>You notice unauthorized access to your account or files.</p><p>Your company laptop, mobile phone, or a USB drive containing company data is lost or stolen.</p><p>You observe suspicious network activity (e.g., unusually high internet traffic).</p><p>Accidental disclosure of confidential data (e.g., emailing sensitive information to the wrong external person).</p><p>You receive a message or screen demanding ransom to unlock your files/computer.</p><p>Importance of Prompt Reporting - The "Golden Hour"</p><h3>Containment: The faster an incident is reported, the quicker our IT/Security team can investigate and contain the spread of the attack, limiting potential damage and impact. Every minute counts!</h3><h3>Damage Control: Reduces the overall impact on business operations, mitigates financial loss, and helps protect our reputation.</h3><h3>Legal & Regulatory Compliance: Enables us to meet mandatory reporting timelines (e.g., CERT-In's strict 6-hour window, DPDP Act breach notification requirements). Delaying reporting can lead to severe penalties.</h3><h3>Investigation: Allows our security team to collect crucial forensic evidence (logs, file timestamps) that helps them understand how the attack happened, who was responsible, and how to prevent future incidents.</h3><p>What to Do if You Suspect an Incident - Your Action Plan</p><h3>DO NOT Panic: Stay calm. A clear head helps you follow procedures.</h3><p>IMMEDIATELY Disconnect (If Safe & Possible):</p><p>If you suspect malware, ransomware, or unauthorized access, disconnect your computer from the network. Unplug the Ethernet cable or turn off Wi-Fi.</p><p>Do not turn off or restart the computer unless specifically instructed by IT/Security (turning it off can destroy valuable forensic evidence needed for investigation).</p><h3>DO NOT Try to Fix It Yourself: Do not attempt to investigate, delete files, run unauthorized tools, or try to "clean" your system. This can destroy critical evidence and worsen the situation.</h3><h3>REPORT IMMEDIATELY:</h3><p>Contact the Designated Company Contact for Security Incidents (e.g., IT Helpdesk, Security Operations Center (SOC), or use the designated email/hotline).</p><p>Company Incident Response Hotline/Email: [Provide Specific Phone Number and/or Email Address - Make this prominent!]</p><h3>Provide as much detail as possible:</h3><p>What happened? (e.g., "I clicked a suspicious link," "My files are encrypted," "My computer is behaving strangely.")</p><p>When did it happen? (Date and time).</p><p>What did you observe? (Specific error messages, strange pop-ups, changed file names).</p><p>Any emails, messages, or files involved?</p><p>Your contact information.</p><h3>Cooperate with Investigation: Be prepared to provide any information requested by the incident response team. They may need access to your device or accounts.</h3><h3>Do NOT Discuss Externally: Do not discuss the incident with unauthorized personnel, outside the incident response team, or on social media. Confidentiality is paramount during an incident.</h3>
