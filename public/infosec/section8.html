            <p>Data Security Best Practices - Protecting Our Information</p><p>These practices ensure our data remains Confidential, maintains Integrity, and stays Available.</p><ul><li>. Data Classification - Knowing Your Data</li><h3>Concept: Categorizing data based on its sensitivity, value, and regulatory requirements. This helps us apply the right level of protection.</h3></ul><p>Our Classifications (Example):</p><h3>Public: Information intended for general public consumption (e.g., marketing material).</h3><h3>Internal: Company information not intended for public release, but generally shared within the company (e.g., internal memos).</h3><h3>Confidential: Sensitive business information, intellectual property, or non-public financial data (e.g., product designs, strategic plans, unreleased earnings).</h3><p>Restricted/Highly Confidential: Most sensitive data, whose unauthorized disclosure would cause severe damage (e.g., customer PII/SPDI, employee records, critical financial data, trade secrets). This requires the highest level of protection.</p><h3>Importance: Knowing a document's classification helps you understand how to handle it: where it can be stored, who it can be shared with, and how it should be disposed of.</h3><ul><li>. Access Control (Least Privilege Principle) - Who Sees What</li><h3>Principle: Users should only have access to the data and systems absolutely necessary to perform their specific job functions, and nothing more. This limits the "blast radius" if an account is compromised.</h3><h3>Practices:</h3><h3>Regularly Review: Access rights are reviewed periodically to ensure they are still appropriate for current roles.</h3></ul><p>Prompt Removal/Modification: Access is removed promptly when an employee's role changes or they leave the company.</p><p>Role-Based Access: Access is granted based on your job role, not individual requests.</p><h3>Strong Authentication: Always use your unique login credentials and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).</h3><ul><li>. Strong Password & Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - Your Digital Keys</li></ul><p>Passwords (Your FIRST Line of Defense):</p><h3>Long & Complex: Aim for at least 12-16 characters. Combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.</h3><h3>Unique: Never reuse passwords across different accounts (especially between personal and work accounts).</h3><p>Memorize (Don't Write Down!): If you must, use a secure password manager.</p><h3>Never Share: Your password is yours alone. Our IT team will NEVER ask for your password.</h3><p>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - Your SECOND Layer of Defense:</p><p>Adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password (e.g., a code from an authenticator app, a fingerprint scan, a one-time password via SMS to your registered mobile).</p><p>Always enable MFA wherever possible for all corporate accounts (email, VPN, internal systems) and for your critical personal accounts. It drastically reduces the risk of account compromise.</p><ul><li>. Data Encryption - Speaking in Code</li><h3>Concept: Converting data into a coded, unreadable format that can only be deciphered with the correct key. This protects data even if unauthorized access occurs.</h3></ul><p>Where We Encrypt (and You Should Too!):</p><h3>Data at Rest: Encrypt data stored on hard drives (your laptop, desktop, servers), cloud storage, and databases.</h3><h3>Actionable: Ensure your company-issued laptop's hard drive is encrypted (check with IT if unsure).</h3><h3>Data in Transit: Encrypt data as it travels across networks (e.g., using HTTPS for websites, VPNs for remote access, secure file transfer protocols).</h3><h3>Actionable: Always use company-approved secure channels for transferring sensitive files.</h3><h3>Company Policy: Our company encrypts all sensitive data at rest and in transit using industry-standard protocols.</h3><ul><li>. Data Backup & Recovery - Our Safety Net</li><h3>Importance: Critical for recovering from ransomware attacks, accidental deletion, system failures, or natural disasters. Backups ensure Availability.</h3></ul><p>Best Practices (The 3-2-1 Rule for Critical Data):</p><ul><li>copies of your critical data (original + two backups).</li></ul><p>On 2 different types of storage media (e.g., internal hard drive, network drive, cloud).</p><ul><li>copy stored off-site (e.g., in a secure cloud backup separate from your primary data center, or a physically separate location).</li><h3>Regular Testing: Backups must be regularly tested to ensure they are recoverable and uncorrupted.</h3></ul><p>Your Action!: Ensure your critical work documents are saved on designated network drives or cloud storage solutions that are part of the company's backup strategy, NOT just on your local desktop.</p><ul><li>. Secure Data Disposal - Leaving No Traces</li><h3>Concept: Properly and securely disposing of data, both digital and physical, so it cannot be recovered or accessed by unauthorized individuals. Simple deletion is NOT enough for digital data.</h3><h3>Digital Data:</h3></ul><p>Hard Drives/SSDs: Use data wiping or degaussing (demagnetizing) software that overwrites data multiple times.</p><h3>Mobile Devices: Perform a factory reset and ensure data wiping.</h3><h3>Company Devices: Never dispose of company devices yourself. Return them to IT for proper secure disposal.</h3><h3>Physical Data:</h3><h3>Confidential Documents: Always shred documents containing confidential, sensitive, or personal information. Do not just throw them in the trash.</h3><h3>Storage Media: Physically destroy CDs, DVDs, USB drives that contain sensitive information.</h3><p>Your Action!: Follow company guidelines for disposing of physical and digital records. When in doubt, shred it or ask IT.</p>
