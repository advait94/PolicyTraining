            <p>Network & Endpoint Security - Our Digital Fortifications</p><p>These are the technical safeguards protecting our digital perimeter and individual devices.</p><p>Network Security - Protecting Our Digital Headquarters</p><h3>Firewalls: Think of firewalls as the security guards at our network's gates. They act as a barrier between our internal network and external networks (like the internet), controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. They block unauthorized access attempts.</h3><p>Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):</p><h3>IDS: Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts our security administrators. It's like a silent alarm system.</h3><h3>IPS: Actively blocks or prevents detected threats from entering the network or spreading within it. It's like the security guard who immediately apprehends the intruder.</h3><p>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs):</p><p>Creates a secure, encrypted "tunnel" connection over a public network (like the internet) to our company network.</p><h3>Mandatory for Remote Access: When working from home, a café, or traveling, connecting to our company network via VPN ensures your data in transit is protected from eavesdropping.</h3><p>Your Action!: Always use the company-provided VPN when accessing internal resources remotely. Do not use unsecured public Wi-Fi without a VPN.</p><p>Secure Wi-Fi Practices:</p><p>Our company Wi-Fi uses strong encryption (WPA2/WPA3) and complex passwords.</p><p>Your Action!:</p><p>Avoid connecting to unsecured public Wi-Fi networks (e.g., in cafes, airports) for company work unless using the company-approved VPN.</p><p>Be cautious about "free Wi-Fi" hotspots, as they can be fake and used to steal data.</p><p>Endpoint Security - Protecting Your Workstation</p><h3>Definition: Protecting individual computing devices (endpoints) such as your company laptop, desktop, mobile phone, and servers from cyber threats. These are your personal digital workspaces.</h3><p>Antivirus & Anti-Malware Software:</p><h3>Mandatory: This software is installed on all company-issued devices. It detects, prevents, and removes malicious software.</h3><p>Your Action!:</p><h3>Keep it updated: Ensure your antivirus definition files are current (often automatic, but verify).</h3><p>Enable real-time scanning: Make sure the software is actively monitoring your system.</p><h3>Perform regular full system scans: As advised by IT.</h3><p>Never disable your antivirus software.</p><p>Patch Management (Keeping Software Up-to-Date):</p><h3>Concept: Regularly updating operating systems (Windows, macOS), applications (browsers, office suites), and firmware with the latest security patches released by vendors.</h3><p>Why it's Critical: Patches fix known vulnerabilities that attackers frequently exploit. Unpatched software is an open door for cybercriminals.</p><p>Your Action!:</p><p>Do not delay updates on company-issued devices. Allow updates to run as scheduled.</p><p>Report any issues encountered during updates to IT.</p><p>Device Security (Physical & Digital):</p><h3>Physical Security:</h3><h3>Keep devices locked: Never leave your laptop or mobile phone unattended in public places.</h3><h3>Secure your workspace: Lock your office desk/cabin.</h3><p>Use cable locks where provided.</p><h3>Encryption:</h3><p>Ensure your device hard drives are encrypted (e.g., BitLocker for Windows, FileVault for macOS). This protects data if the device is lost or stolen.</p><p>Your Action!: Confirm with IT that your device is encrypted.</p><p>Password/PIN/Biometrics: Enable strong authentication (PIN, password, fingerprint, facial recognition) for device unlock.</p><p>Lost/Stolen Devices: Report immediately to IT so devices can be remotely wiped or locked, preventing data compromise.</p><h3>Software Installation Policy:</h3><p>Your Action!:</p><p>Only install company-approved software from official sources (e.g., our internal software distribution portal).</p><p>Avoid installing unverified third-party applications, games, or browser extensions. These can contain malware or create vulnerabilities.</p><p>Be cautious about granting excessive permissions to apps, especially on mobile devices.</p>
