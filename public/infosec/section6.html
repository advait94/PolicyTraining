            <p>Indian Legal & Regulatory Framework for Cybersecurity</p><p>Understanding our legal obligations is fundamental to our cybersecurity strategy. Non-compliance can lead to severe penalties.</p><ul><li>. Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) & Amendments</li><h3>The Primary Law: This is India's foundational legislation governing cybercrime, electronic commerce, and data protection. It provides the legal framework for addressing digital activities.</h3></ul><p>Key Provisions (Relevant to Cybersecurity - Know These!):</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>Important Notice</h3>
                    <p>Section 43 (Penalty for damage to computer etc.): Imposes penalties for unauthorized access, data theft, denial of service, data alteration, and other damages to computer systems/data.</p>
                </div>
            </div><h3>Actionable: Don't engage in any unauthorized access or activities, even out of curiosity.</h3><p>Section 66 (Computer related offences): Defines and penalizes various cybercrimes, including hacking, data theft, identity theft, cheating by impersonation using computer resources.</p><h3>Actionable: Be aware of these crimes and how your actions might inadvertently enable them.</h3><p>Section 66B (Punishment for dishonestly receiving stolen computer resource or communication device): Penalizes receiving a stolen computer or communication device.</p><p>Section 66F (Punishment for cyber terrorism): Imposes severe penalties for acts like unauthorized access to critical information infrastructure with intent to cause harm, or disrupting computer networks.</p>

                    <p>Section 72 (Penalty for breach of confidentiality and privacy): Penalizes anyone who, having secured access to electronic record, document, or information by virtue of the IT Act, discloses it without consent or lawful authority.</p>
                </div>
            </div><h3>Actionable: Strict adherence to data privacy and confidentiality.</h3><p>Section 79 (Exemption from liability of intermediary in certain cases): Defines the role of intermediaries (e.g., social media platforms, ISPs, cloud providers) and outlines conditions under which they may be held liable for content or activities on their platforms.</p><p>Section 85 (Offences by companies): States that if an offense under the IT Act is committed by a company, the person in charge and responsible for the conduct of the business, as well as the company itself, shall be liable, unless due diligence is proven.</p><h3>Implication: This means individuals (like you!) can be held personally accountable if they fail in their duties.</h3><p>Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011 (IT Rules):</p><h3>Mandate: These rules specify "reasonable security practices" that entities collecting, storing, or processing "Sensitive Personal Data or Information (SPDI)" must follow.</h3><h3>SPDI Categories: Include passwords, financial information (bank account, credit/debit card details), health conditions, sexual orientation, biometric information, and any other information relating to the individual that is received, stored, or processed.</h3><h3>Key Requirements: These rules mandate a comprehensive documented privacy policy, explicit consent for SPDI collection, purpose limitation, disclosure controls, and a grievance redressal mechanism.</h3><h3>Actionable: Our company's internal data handling policies are designed to comply with these rules. You must follow them diligently, especially when handling SPDI.</h3><ul><li>. Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP Act)</li></ul><p>India's New Data Protection Law: This is a landmark, comprehensive law specifically governing the processing of digital personal data in India. It will strengthen privacy rights and impose stricter obligations.</p><h3>Key Relevance to Cybersecurity:</h3><p>Section 8(5) (Obligations of Data Fiduciary): Explicitly mandates Data Fiduciaries (our company) to implement reasonable security safeguards to prevent personal data breaches. This is a direct, legally binding cybersecurity obligation.</p><h3>Actionable: Our investment in security infrastructure, software, and this very training is directly linked to this obligation. Your adherence to security protocols directly contributes to fulfilling this.</h3><p>Section 8(6) (Obligation to notify data breach): Requires Data Fiduciaries to notify the Data Protection Board of India and affected Data Principals (individuals) in case of a personal data breach. Rules will specify the timeline and manner of notification.</p><p>Implication: Rapid incident reporting (as discussed in Slide 10) is crucial for us to meet these notification deadlines.</p><h3>Penalties: Imposes significant penalties for failure to protect data (up to INR 250 Crore for security safeguard failures).</h3><h3>Impact: This underscores the financial and reputational risk of a data breach stemming from inadequate security.</h3><h3>Implication: The DPDP Act significantly elevates the importance of robust cybersecurity measures for any organization processing digital personal data in India. It moves beyond just preventing hacking to actively protecting personal data.</h3><ul><li>. Cybersecurity Policies & Guidelines (CERT-In)</li></ul><p>Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In): This is the national nodal agency for cybersecurity incident response in India. They are our go-to authority for guidance and alerts.</p><h3>Role: CERT-In issues crucial advisories, alerts, and guidelines on cybersecurity incidents, emerging vulnerabilities, and best practices. They act as the central point for reporting and coordinating responses to cyber incidents in India.</h3><p>Key Directives (Actionable!): CERT-In has issued various directives that directly impact our operations, most notably:</p><h3>Mandatory Reporting of Cybersecurity Incidents: Requires all service providers, data centers, government organizations, and corporate bodies to mandatorily report cybersecurity incidents to CERT-In within 6 hours of noticing or being brought to notice of such incidents.</h3><h3>This includes: Data breaches, system intrusions, ransomware attacks, unauthorized access, identity theft, and more.</h3><h3>Maintenance of ICT Logs: Requires organizations to store and maintain their Information and Communication Technology (ICT) logs for a rolling period of 180 days in India.</h3><h3>Impact: Our company must strictly adhere to CERT-In's directives and reporting requirements. Your prompt incident reporting directly feeds into our ability to comply with these mandatory timelines.</h3><ul><li>. Sector-Specific Regulations</li></ul><p>Beyond national laws, many industries have their own specific cybersecurity regulations:</p><p>Reserve Bank of India (RBI): Extensive guidelines for banks, financial institutions, and payment system operators on IT governance, cyber security frameworks, and incident reporting (e.g., RBI Circular on 'Cyber Security Framework for Banks', 'Master Direction on Digital Payment Security Controls').</p><p>Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI): Cybersecurity and cyber resilience frameworks for market infrastructure institutions (e.g., stock exchanges) and other regulated entities.</p><p>Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI): Guidelines for insurers on information and cybersecurity management.</p><p>And many more...</p><p>Our Compliance Commitment</p><p>Our company is unequivocally committed to fully complying with the IT Act, DPDP Act, CERT-In directives, and all applicable sector-specific regulations relevant to our business.</p><p>This training is a vital part of our commitment to building a legally compliant, ethically sound, and cyber-resilient organization.</p>
