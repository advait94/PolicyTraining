            <p>Your Role & Responsibilities in Cybersecurity - BE OUR HUMAN FIREWALL!</p><h3>Remember: Cybersecurity is a team sport. Your active participation is our strongest defense.</h3><p>You are Our First Line of Defense!</p><p>No matter your role, your department, or your seniority, every single employee is personally responsible for safeguarding our company's information assets.</p><p>A strong security posture is a collective effort, not just an IT department's responsibility. You are the Human Firewall.</p><p>Your Key Responsibilities - Actionable Steps for Every Day</p><h3>Be Aware & Educated:</h3><p>Actively participate in all mandatory security training sessions like this one. Ask questions!</p><p>Stay informed about the latest cyber threats and trends. Read internal security newsletters or advisories.</p><p>Understand and follow all company security policies and procedures. Ignorance is not an excuse.</p><p>Protect Your Credentials (Your Digital Identity):</p><p>Use strong, unique passwords for all your company accounts. Aim for passphrases (e.g., MyCatLovesPizza!2025).</p><p>Enable and use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) always, wherever it's available. It's your best defense against stolen passwords.</p><p>Never share your passwords with anyone, not even IT.</p><p>Never write down passwords in an unsecured location. Use a company-approved password manager if needed.</p><p>Exercise Caution Online (The Click Test!):</p><p>Be hyper-vigilant against phishing, spear-phishing, and all forms of social engineering attacks.</p><h3>Before you click a link: Hover over it to see the actual URL. If it looks suspicious or redirects to an unfamiliar domain, DON'T CLICK.</h3><h3>Before you open an attachment: Verify the sender, especially if it's unexpected. If unsure, delete it or report it to IT.</h3><h3>Beware of urgency and unusual requests: Cybercriminals thrive on panic. Take a moment to think.</h3><p>Verify the sender's identity: If an email seems off, call the sender on a known number (from the company directory, not the email signature) to confirm.</p><h3>Secure Your Devices & Workspace:</h3><h3>Physical Security: Keep company-issued devices (laptops, phones) physically secure. Never leave them unattended in public places.</h3><h3>Lock Your Screen: Always lock your computer screen when you step away from your desk, even for a moment (Windows: Win + L, Mac: Ctrl + Cmd + Q).</h3><h3>Device Encryption: Ensure your device hard drives are encrypted. Check with IT if unsure.</h3><h3>Unauthorized Software: Do not install unauthorized software, games, or browser extensions on company devices. These can introduce vulnerabilities or malware.</h3><h3>Secure Disposal: Dispose of confidential physical documents by shredding them. Return company devices to IT for proper secure disposal.</h3><h3>Handle Data Responsibly:</h3><h3>Data Classification: Understand the classification levels of data you work with (e.g., Confidential, Restricted) and handle it accordingly (e.g., no confidential data on personal cloud drives).</h3><h3>Access Control: Only access data that is absolutely necessary for your specific job function. Don't snoop.</h3><h3>Secure Sharing: Use only company-approved secure channels for sharing sensitive data, both internally and externally. Avoid unsecured email or personal chat apps.</h3><h3>No Unauthorized Storage: Do not store sensitive company data on unauthorized personal devices, personal cloud services (like personal Google Drive/Dropbox), or external USB drives unless specifically approved and encrypted.</h3><h3>Encrypt Sensitive Files: When in doubt about sharing sensitive data, ask IT about encryption options.</h3><p>Report Immediately (Don't Hesitate!):</p><p>Report any suspected security incident, suspicious activity (e.g., strange email, unusual computer behavior), or policy violation to [Designated Security/IT Contact/Hotline] without delay.</p><p>Report lost or stolen devices immediately. Time is critical for remote wiping or locking.</p><p>Your report is vital. It helps protect the entire organization. There will be no negative repercussions for reporting a suspected incident in good faith.</p><h3>Think Before You Act:</h3><p>Before any action, pause and consider the security implications.</p><p>If something feels "off" or too good to be true, it probably is a scam.</p><p>When in doubt, ask for help from IT/Security. We are here to support you!</p>
