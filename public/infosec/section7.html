            <p>Common Cyber Threats - What We Face Every Day</p><p>Understanding the enemy helps us defend better. Here are the most common threats you'll encounter:</p><ul><li>. Malware (Malicious Software)</li><h3>Definition: Any software specifically designed to cause damage to a computer, server, or network system, or gain unauthorized access.</h3></ul><p>Types (Be Aware!):</p><h3>Viruses: Attach to legitimate programs (like an infected file or application) and spread when those programs are executed.</h3><h3>Worms: Self-replicating malware that spreads autonomously across networks without needing a host program.</h3><h3>Trojan Horses: Masquerade as legitimate software (e.g., a "free game" or "useful utility") to trick users into installing them, then provide backdoors for attackers.</h3><h3>Spyware: Secretly monitors user activity (e.g., keystrokes, browsing history, screenshots) and collects sensitive information without consent.</h3><h3>Adware: Displays unwanted advertisements, often bundled with free software.</h3><h3>Rootkits: Stealthy tools that enable unauthorized access to a computer and hide their presence, often by modifying operating system processes.</h3><p>How it Spreads (Your Action!):</p><h3>Malicious Email Attachments: The most common vector.</h3><h3>Infected Websites: Visiting compromised or malicious websites.</h3><h3>Compromised Downloads: Downloading software from unofficial sources.</h3><p>USB Drives/External Media: Plugging in untrusted USB sticks.</p><ul><li>. Phishing & Social Engineering - The Human Element Attack</li><h3>Phishing: Deceptive attempts to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information (like passwords, bank details) or installing malware by impersonating a trustworthy entity (e.g., a bank, IT department, senior management) in electronic communication (email, SMS).</h3><h3>Spear Phishing: Highly targeted phishing attacks against specific individuals or organizations, often using personalized information.</h3><h3>Whaling: Even more targeted phishing against senior executives or high-profile individuals ("the big fish").</h3><h3>Smishing: Phishing via SMS (text messages).</h3><h3>Vishing: Phishing via voice calls.</h3><h3>Social Engineering: The art of manipulating people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. It exploits human psychology, trust, curiosity, fear, or a sense of urgency. It's often the gateway to other attacks.</h3><h3>Pretexting: Creating a fabricated scenario (a "pretext") to extract information (e.g., pretending to be IT support to get your login).</h3><h3>Baiting: Offering something enticing (e.g., a "free movie download," an infected USB left in a parking lot) to lure victims into a trap.</h3><h3>Quid Pro Quo: Promising a benefit (e.g., "I'll fix your internet if you give me your password") in exchange for information or action.</h3></ul><p>Your Action!: BE SUSPICIOUS! Verify, verify, verify. This is your most critical defense. (More on this on Slide 9).</p><ul><li>. Ransomware - The Business Crippler</li><h3>Definition: A particularly nasty type of malware that encrypts a victim's files or locks their entire computer system, then demands a ransom payment (usually in hard-to-trace cryptocurrency like Bitcoin) to restore access.</h3><h3>Impact: Can entirely halt business operations, lead to massive financial loss (both ransom and recovery costs), and result in permanent data loss if robust backups are not available or are also encrypted.</h3></ul><p>How it Spreads (Your Action!): Primarily through phishing emails, malicious websites, or exploiting unpatched software vulnerabilities.</p><ul><li>. Denial-of-Service (DoS) / Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) - System Shutdown</li><h3>Definition: Attacks designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by overwhelming it with traffic or disrupting its services.</h3><h3>DDoS: A DoS attack launched from multiple compromised computer systems (a "botnet") simultaneously, making it harder to block.</h3><h3>Impact: Website downtime, interruption of critical online services, significant reputational damage, and financial losses due to lost business.</h3><li>. Insider Threats - The Risk from Within</li><h3>Definition: Security risks that originate from within the organization, often from current or former employees, contractors, or business partners who have legitimate access.</h3><h3>Types:</h3><h3>Malicious Insider: Deliberately steals data, sabotages systems, or causes harm due to intent (e.g., a disgruntled employee, an employee leaving to join a competitor).</h3><h3>Negligent Insider: Unintentionally causes a security incident due to carelessness, poor security practices, or falling for social engineering (e.g., clicking a phishing link, losing a company laptop, sharing credentials). This is far more common!</h3><h3>Impact: Data breaches, intellectual property theft, system sabotage, unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.</h3><li>. Zero-Day Exploits - The Unknown Vulnerability</li><h3>Definition: An attack that exploits a previously unknown software vulnerability for which no patch or fix exists from the vendor.</h3><h3>Risk: Extremely dangerous as security teams have no prior knowledge or available defenses to protect against them until the vulnerability is discovered and a patch is released.</h3></ul><p>Your Action!: While difficult to defend against directly, robust general security practices (least privilege, network segmentation) help limit their impact.</p>
