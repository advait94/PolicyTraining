            <h3>The Human Element: Social Engineering & Your Vigilance</h3><p>YOU are our strongest defense, or our weakest link. Let's make you our strongest!</p><h3>Social Engineering Revisited: Why Attackers Target YOU</h3><p>Cybercriminals often target humans because it's generally easier than breaking through robust technical defenses like firewalls or encryption.</p><h3>They exploit fundamental human traits:</h3><h3>Trust: Impersonating someone you know or trust (IT, HR, senior manager).</h3><h3>Curiosity: "Click this link to see who viewed your profile!"</h3><p>Fear/Urgency: "Your account will be suspended in 24 hours if you don't act now!"</p><h3>Greed: "Congratulations, you've won a lottery! Click here to claim your prize."</h3><h3>Authority: Impersonating a CEO demanding immediate action.</h3><h3>Remember: No technical control can fully protect against a determined social engineer if you are not vigilant. You are the "Human Firewall."</h3><p>Common Social Engineering Tactics - Watch Out for These!</p><p>Phishing Emails/Messages (The Most Common!):</p><p>Urgent, Demanding Language: "Immediate action required!", "Your account will be suspended!"</p><h3>Requests for Sensitive Information: Asking for your login credentials, bank details, Aadhaar/PAN, or OTPs.</h3><h3>Impersonation: Email appears to be from a colleague, manager, IT, or a known vendor, but the email address is slightly off (e.g., ceo@ourcomany.com vs. ceo@oourcompany.com).</h3><p>Unexpected Attachments/Links: An email with an attachment from an unknown sender, or a link to a suspicious website.</p><p>Grammatical Errors, Spelling Mistakes, Awkward Phrasing: Often a strong indicator of a non-legitimate source.</p><h3>Generic Greetings: "Dear Customer" instead of your name.</h3><h3>Suspicious URLs: Hover your mouse over the link (without clicking!) to see the actual destination. Does it match the apparent sender?</h3><p>Impersonation (Vishing/Pretexting):</p><p>Vishing (Voice Phishing): Someone calling claiming to be from IT support, HR, a bank, or a vendor, asking for your password, OTP, or other sensitive information over the phone.</p><h3>Pretexting: A criminal creates a fabricated scenario (e.g., "I'm from our external audit firm, I need your login to review our system") to extract information.</h3><p>Your Action!: Always verify the identity of unexpected callers or emailers. If someone calls claiming to be from IT, tell them you'll call them back using the official, known IT helpdesk number, not a number they provide.</p><p>Tailgating/Piggybacking:</p><p>An unauthorized person following an authorized person through a secure access point (e.g., holding a door open behind you, slipping in while you badge in).</p><p>Your Action!: Always ensure proper access control measures (e.g., closing doors behind you, challenging unknown individuals in restricted areas, ensuring visitors have badges).</p><h3>Baiting:</h3><p>Leaving infected USB drives or other enticing devices (e.g., a "free company gift" USB) in public places (e.g., parking lots, lobbies) hoping someone will pick them up and plug them into their computer out of curiosity.</p><p>Your Action!: Never plug unknown USB drives or external devices into your company laptop or desktop. Turn them over to IT if found.</p><p>How to Be Vigilant (Your Daily Checklist - Think Before You Click/Act!)</p><p>STOP, LOOK, THINK! This is your golden rule. Before clicking any link, opening an attachment, or responding to an unusual request, pause for a moment.</p><h3>Verify the Sender: Always check the full email address, not just the display name. Does it match the sender? Is it from a legitimate domain (e.g., ourcompany.com, not ourcompony.biz)?</h3><h3>Hover Before You Click: Hover your mouse over links (without clicking!) to see the actual URL in the bottom-left corner of your browser. Does it look legitimate? If it looks suspicious, don't click!</h3><h3>Beware of Urgency & Threats: Cybercriminals often create a false sense of panic or urgency to bypass critical thinking. Take a moment to evaluate the request calmly. Is it truly urgent?</h3><h3>Be Suspicious of Unexpected Requests: Especially for login credentials, financial information, or gift cards, even if they appear to come from internal sources. Always verify via a different trusted channel.</h3><p>Report, Don't Delete: If you suspect a phishing email, a suspicious call, or any unusual activity, do not delete it or try to handle it yourself. Report it to [Designated Security/IT Team/Hotline] immediately. Your report helps protect everyone.</p><h3>Guard Physical Access: Protect your workspace, devices, and sensitive documents. Don't let unauthorized persons tailgate you into secure areas. Challenge unknown individuals.</h3><h3>Use Official Channels: If an unusual request comes via email, verify it using a different, known communication channel (e.g., call the person on their known work number from the company directory, don't reply to the suspicious email).</h3>
