            <h3>Understanding the Basics: InfoSec & CyberSec Concepts</h3><p>Information Security (InfoSec)</p><h3>Definition: InfoSec is the overarching practice of protecting information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. It applies to information in all its forms – digital, physical (paper documents), and even verbal discussions.</h3><h3>Focus: It's a holistic approach, encompassing people, processes, and technology to ensure the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad) of all our information assets.</h3><p>Pillars of InfoSec (The CIA Triad) - Our Core Principles:</p><h3>Confidentiality: This means ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to view it.</h3><h3>Think: Keeping secrets secret.</h3><h3>Examples: Encrypting sensitive files, implementing strict access controls (who can view what), shredding confidential documents, not discussing sensitive matters in public places.</h3><h3>Integrity: This means maintaining the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data throughout its entire lifecycle. Data should not be altered without authorization.</h3><h3>Think: Keeping information trustworthy and uncorrupted.</h3><h3>Examples: Using data validation checks, ensuring file checksums match, controlling who can modify records, having version control for critical documents.</h3><h3>Availability: This means ensuring that authorized users have timely and uninterrupted access to information and systems when needed.</h3><h3>Think: Keeping systems up and running.</h3><h3>Examples: Regular data backups, implementing disaster recovery plans, ensuring robust network infrastructure, protecting against denial-of-service attacks.</h3><p>Cybersecurity</p><h3>Definition: Cybersecurity is a subset of Information Security, specifically focused on protecting computer systems, networks, and digital data from digital attacks, damage, or unauthorized access.</h3><h3>Focus: It involves specific technical controls, tools, processes, and human practices to defend our digital environment.</h3><h3>Key Areas: Network security (firewalls, VPNs), application security (secure coding), endpoint security (antivirus, device encryption), cloud security, data security (encryption, DLP), and incident response.</h3><p>Threat, Vulnerability, and Risk - Understanding the Equation</p><h3>Threat: A potential danger that could exploit a vulnerability to breach security and cause harm.</h3><h3>Examples: A cybercriminal, a malicious insider, a piece of malware, a natural disaster (e.g., flood causing server damage).</h3><h3>Vulnerability: A weakness or flaw in a system, process, or design that could be exploited by a threat.</h3><h3>Examples: Unpatched software, a weak password, lack of encryption on a sensitive file, a lax policy, an untrained employee.</h3><h3>Risk: The potential for loss, damage, or destruction of an asset as a result of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.</h3><h3>Formula: Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x Asset Value.</h3><h3>Our Goal: To identify, assess, and mitigate these risks to an acceptable level through robust security measures and vigilance.</h3>
