                    <h3>Definition / Key Concept</h3>
                    <p>What is GDPR?</p>
                </div>
            </div><p>A comprehensive data protection law enacted by the European Union (EU) in 2016, and became enforceable on May 25, 2018.</p><p>It sets out a robust legal framework for the collection, processing, and storage of personal information of individuals located within the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes all EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway.</p><h3>Primary Aims: To give individuals greater control over their personal data ("data subjects' rights") and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by harmonizing data protection laws across the EEA.</h3><h3>Applicability: Territorial and Extraterritorial Scope</h3><p>Territorial Scope (Article 3(1)): Applies to the processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the EU, regardless of whether the processing itself takes place in the EU or not.</p><h3>Example: Our company has an office in Berlin. All data processing by that office, regardless of whereglobecono subjects are located, falls under GDPR.</h3><p>Extraterritorial Scope (Article 3(2) - "Targeting Criterion"): This is critical for organizations outside the EU. GDPR applies to controllers or processors NOT established in the EU, if they process personal data of data subjects who are in the EU AND their processing activities relate to:</p><p>Offering goods or services to such data subjects in the EU (even if no payment is required, i.e., free services).</p><p>Monitoring their behavior as far as their behavior takes place within the EU (e.g., tracking website visitors, using cookies for analytics, online profiling of EU residents).</p><h3>Implication for us: Even if our company is based in India and has no physical presence in the EU, if we offer services to EU residents (e.g., online customers) or monitor their online behavior within the EU (e.g., through our website analytics), GDPR applies to us for that processing. This necessitates compliance with GDPR requirements for such data.</h3><p>Key Principles Revisited (Article 5)</p><p>Lawfulness, fairness and transparency: Data must be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner. l</p><h3>Purpose limitation: Collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.</h3><h3>Data minimisation: Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.</h3><h3>Accuracy: Accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. Every reasonable step must be taken to ensure inaccurate personal data are erased or rectified without delay.</h3><h3>Storage limitation: Kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed.</h3><h3>Integrity and confidentiality: Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.</h3><h3>Accountability: The controller is responsible for and must be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR principles.</h3><p>Lawful Basis for Processing (Article 6)</p><p>For any processing of personal data to be lawful under GDPR, it must be based on at least one of these six specific grounds. This is a fundamental requirement.</p><h3>Consent: The individual has given clear, specific, informed, and unambiguous consent for one or more specific purposes. Consent must be freely given and easily withdrawable.</h3><h3>Contract: Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with the individual (e.g., processing address for product delivery) or to take steps at their request before entering into a contract (e.g., pre-contractual inquiries).</h3><h3>Legal Obligation: Processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject (e.g., tax reporting, fraud prevention laws). This excludes contractual obligations.</h3><h3>Vital Interests: Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the individual or another natural person (e.g., in a medical emergency where consent cannot be obtained).</h3><h3>Public Task: Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller (e.g., government functions, public health).</h3><h3>Legitimate Interests: Processing is necessary for the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject (especially if a child is involved). This requires a careful balancing test between the organization's interest and the individual's rights.</h3><ul><li>: GDPR - Key Rights of Data Subjects</li></ul><p>GDPR empowers data subjects with several key rights regarding their personal data, reinforcing their control and autonomy:</p><p>Right to Information (Articles 13 & 14):</p><p>Individuals have the right to be informed about the collection and use of their personal data.</p><p>This includes comprehensive details about the data controller, purposes of processing, legal basis, categories of data processed, recipients of data, retention periods, and all other rights they possess.</p><p>Information must be provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.</p><p>Right of Access (Article 15 - "Subject Access Request" - SAR):</p><p>Individuals have the right to obtain confirmation from the controller as to whether or not personal data concerning them is being processed.</p><p>If so, they have the right to access that data and receive a copy of their personal data free of charge (unless requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive).</p><p>This enables individuals to verify the lawfulness of processing.</p><p>Right to Rectification (Article 16):</p><p>Individuals have the right to have inaccurate personal data concerning them rectified without undue delay.</p><p>They also have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.</p><p>Right to Erasure / "Right to be Forgotten" (Article 17):</p><p>Individuals have the right to request the deletion or removal of their personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing.</p><p>This applies in specific circumstances, e.g., when the data is no longer necessary for the original purpose, consent is withdrawn, processing is unlawful, or the data must be erased to comply with a legal obligation.</p><p>Right to Restriction of Processing (Article 18):</p><p>Individuals have the right to block or suppress the processing of their personal data in certain circumstances.</p><p>This means data can be stored but not further processed, e.g., when the accuracy of the data is contested, or the processing is unlawful but the individual opposes erasure and requests restriction instead.</p><p>Right to Data Portability (Article 20):</p><p>Individuals have the right to receive personal data they have provided to a controller in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format (e.g., CSV, JSON).</p><p>They also have the right to transmit that data to another controller without hindrance from the original controller.</p><p>This right only applies when processing is based on consent or contract, and is carried out by automated means.</p><p>Right to Object (Article 21):</p><p>Individuals have the right to object to processing based on legitimate interests or public tasks, including profiling based on these grounds.</p><p>They have an absolute right to object to processing for direct marketing purposes (including profiling related to direct marketing).</p><p>Rights related to Automated Decision Making & Profiling (Article 22):</p><p>Individuals have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning them or similarly significantly affects them.</p><p>This means they have the right to human intervention, to express their point of view, and to contest the decision.</p><p>Exceptions apply, e.g., if necessary for entering into or performance of a contract, or authorized by EU or Member State law.</p>
