                    <p>What is Data Privacy? Key Concepts</p>
                </div>
            </div><h3>Definition: Data Privacy vs. Data Protection</h3><h3>Data Privacy: Refers to an individual's right to control their personal information and how it is collected, used, processed, and shared. It's about autonomy, choice, and the ethical handling of information.</h3><h3>Data Protection: Refers to the legal, technical, and organizational safeguards and measures put in place by organizations to ensure data privacy. It's about the mechanisms and practices used to enforce privacy rights and secure data.</h3><p>Personal Data / Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</p><p>Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject' or 'data principal'). An identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier.</p><h3>Direct Identifiers: Information that directly points to an individual (e.g., Name, physical address, email address, phone number, passport number, Aadhaar number, PAN number).</h3><h3>Indirect Identifiers: Information that, when combined with other data, can identify an individual (e.g., IP address, cookie ID, device ID, location data, online identifiers, unique customer IDs, factors specific to physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity).</h3><p>Sensitive Personal Data / Special Categories of Data</p><p>Data that, if compromised, could cause significant harm, discrimination, or distress to an individual. These categories typically require a higher level of protection and stricter processing conditions.</p><p>GDPR (Special Categories of Personal Data): Explicitly lists data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data (for identification purposes), data concerning health, and data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation.</p><p>DPDP Act (as per rules to be notified): The DPDP Act itself does not explicitly list "sensitive personal data" categories but empowers the Central Government to notify "critical personal data" or "sensitive personal data" categories through future rules. While not yet defined, it is expected to align broadly with international standards. For now, our company treats data categories similar to GDPR's sensitive data with enhanced care.</p><p>Key Roles in Data Protection</p><p>Data Subject / Data Principal (Individual): The natural person to whom the personal data relates and who is identifiable. (e.g., our employees, customers, website visitors). They are the "owner" of the data.</p><p>Data Controller (GDPR) / Data Fiduciary (DPDP Act): The entity (e.g., our company) that, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of processing personal data. They are primarily responsible for ensuring compliance.</p><p>Data Processor (GDPR) / Data Processor (DPDP Act): The entity that processes personal data on behalf of, and under the instructions of, the Data Controller/Data Fiduciary. (e.g., a cloud service provider, a payroll agency, a marketing vendor).</p><p>Fundamental Data Protection Principles (Common to GDPR & DPDP Act)</p><h3>These principles form the bedrock of ethical and lawful data processing:</h3><p>Lawfulness, Fairness, & Transparency: Personal data must be processed lawfully (with a valid legal basis), fairly (without prejudice to the individual), and in a transparent manner (individuals know what data is collected and how it's used).</p><h3>Purpose Limitation: Data should be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes only, and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those original purposes.</h3><h3>Data Minimization: Only collect personal data that is adequate, relevant, and strictly limited to what is necessary for the stated purpose. Avoid collecting excessive data.</h3><h3>Accuracy: Personal data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up-to-date. Inaccurate data should be rectified or erased without delay.</h3><h3>Storage Limitation: Data should be retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill the stated purposes for which it was collected. Once the purpose is served, data should be securely deleted or anonymized.</h3><p>Integrity & Confidentiality (Security): Personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational measures.</p><h3>Accountability: The Data Controller/Data Fiduciary is responsible for, and must be able to demonstrate compliance with, these principles. This means maintaining records, implementing policies, and having oversight mechanisms.</h3>
